# Circle and cross game app

The project was created as part of the JavaScript learning. 

## General info

The project was a challenge for me to construct logic for a sudoku game. The application was created in vanila, object-oriented Javascript. The game contains 12 boards of varying difficulty. Filling a column, row or square correctly activates the animation. Completing all fields takes the user to the next board.
